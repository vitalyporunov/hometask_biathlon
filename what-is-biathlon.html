            <h2>A Fusion of Skiing and Shooting</h2>
            <p>Biathlon is a captivating winter sport that combines the endurance of cross-country skiing with the precision of rifle shooting. Athletes race on a cross-country ski course, stopping at designated shooting ranges to fire at targets. Missed shots result in penalty loops or extra time added to their overall race time. </p>

            <h2>History of Biathlon</h2>
            <p>Biathlon has its roots in ancient hunting and military traditions. It evolved from military skiing exercises in Scandinavia and eventually became a competitive sport in the 20th century. The first biathlon world championships were held in 1958, and biathlon was included in the Winter Olympics in 1960.</p>
